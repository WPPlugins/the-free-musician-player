This plugin is part of a larger project to provide musicians with online tools. We're using http://browserstack.com to check our forthcoming front-end templates on every imaginable device. Many thanks for their great product and their generous support of our open source development program.

== Installation ==

1. unzip package
2. Upload directory `thefreemusician` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to http://littleguybigheart.net/tfmplugin/instructions for further instructions
(you'll almost certainly need to - wordpress AJAX enabling is not always simple depending on your theme)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When I browse to another page, my music stops when it should keep playing =

You haven't enabled your AJAX in the setting panel (it's disabled by default because it's tricky!)
Read the instructions at http://littleguybigheart.net/tfmplugin/instructions

= I get this error on activation =

Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING in /home/heatherp/public_html/wp/test013/wp-content/plugins/thefreemusician/ob_settings_v1_3.php on line 14

I don't know why this happens but my next priority is to replace this piec of code anyway - so it'll be fixed soon...
